    article: `This couple rushed to me at a restaurant and told me that they had a testimony to share with me. They said that, a few years ago, they came to one of my Crusades looking for a child, and I ministered to them and gave them a word. They said that conception happened within a month, and God blessed them with the child in the picture!`,

    article: `She underwent an abdominal surgical procedure.
    Due to a medical mistake, she had serious complications, the area reopened, refused to heal, with a lot of pus constantly coming out of her belly through it, and she found it almost impossible to eat, deteriorated into a vegetative condition, became paralyzed, and found no solution to her case!
    It was in this condition that she was brought.
    When God's servant Sign Fireman ministered to her, on the spot the area dried up, the pus ceased, the paralysis ended and she began to walk ... unaided, and she became hungry and went to eat.
    The first two pictures show her, a few days later, testifying of her wonderful healing in another service; while the other pictures are pictures of the day she came for her miracle. 
    We give God all the glory for His explosive, omnipotent miracle-working power!`,
