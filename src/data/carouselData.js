    title: `REINHARD BONNKE (1940-2019): "Christianity is either supernatural or nothing at all. We had a supernatural Jesus, with a supernatural ministry, creating a supernatural church, with a supernatural Gospel and a supernatural Bible. Take the miraculous away and you have taken its life away. The church becomes an ethical society. It is in fact the distribution network for the power of the Holy Spirit in a powerless world. You and I are conductors of God’s power to the world!”`,
